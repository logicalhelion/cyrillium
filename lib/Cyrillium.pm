=head1 NAME

Cyrillium - Perl extension for FastCGI web applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #FIXME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for Cyrillium, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

related modules or operating system documentation (such as man pages
in UNIX), or any relevant external documentation such as RFCs or
standards.

If you have a mailing list set up for your module, mention it here.

If you have a web site set up for your module, mention it here.
